### Changes
- Spell Balance Changes:
  - Guiding Bolt
    - Guiding Bolt Projectile Speed increased by 30%
    - Guided Effect duration increased from 15s -> 25s
    - Guided Projectiles home from farther, and more quickly
    - These changes should make hitting the Guiding Bolt debuff more rewarding and worthwhile
  - Fortify
    - Decreased cast range from 16 -> 8 blocks
  - Sunbeam
    - Increased base damage from 10 -> 12
    - Increased damage per level from 1 -> 1.5
    - Decreased windup time from 20 -> 15 ticks
    - These changes should make Sunbeam more viable compared to other pillar aoe spells
  - Heal (Requires Config Reset)
    - Base Healing reduced from 6 -> 5 HP
    - Max Level reduced from 10 -> 8
    - Min Rarity increased from common -> uncommon
    - Cooldown increased from 25s -> 30s
    - Mana Cost per level increased from 10 -> 15
    - While Heal was intended to be a jack-of-all-trades, Heal always outperformed and overshadowed other healing spells in their own niche. These changes should make relying on just Heal without specing holy power less universally viable
  - Blessing of Life
    - Base healing increased from 4 -> 6 HP
  - Healing Circle
    - Increased radius from 4 -> 5 blocks
  - Divine Smite
    - Improved damage hitbox placement
    - Increased damage hitbox radius
