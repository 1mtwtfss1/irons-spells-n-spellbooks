### Changes
- Backported Spell Balance Changes
  - Guiding Bolt
    - Guiding Bolt Projectile Speed increased by 30%
    - Guided Effect duration increased from 15s -> 25s

  - Sunbeam
    - Increased base damage from 10 -> 12
    - Increased damage per level from 1 -> 1.5
    - Decreased windup time from 20 -> 15 ticks
    - These changes should make Sunbeam more viable compared to other pillar aoe spells

    - Min Rarity increased from common -> uncommon

    - Mana Cost per level increased from 10 -> 15
